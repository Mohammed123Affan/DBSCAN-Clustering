# DBSCAN-Clustering
In this project you can apply the idea of ​​clustering using the DBSCAN algorithm. You can search for the best values ​​for eps and minPts using run2 by giving them value ranges. The algorithm will be applied and searched for the best evaluation of the data using the Silhouette algorithm. An illustration of the shape of the clusters will be shown to you using Function pbplots.
